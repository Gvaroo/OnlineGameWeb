This is the server-side implementation of a Tic-Tac-Toe multiplayer game I created using the Spring Framework. Users can authorize and play with boards of different sizes. They have the option to create/join rooms, where they can play in live gameplay with other player. The application also features a leaderboard. For the corresponding front-end implementation, please refer to the 'Client' branch. The front end was developed using the Angular framework.
